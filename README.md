# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is an implementation of the popular TIC-TAC-TOE Game created using the Ruby programming Language

![Tic-tac-toe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68709712/122489322-408ca280-cf94-11eb-8c23-2a7482241f08.png)

Game Rules

* Each player is going to choose a number out of 9 positions.
* First player should enter his name and press enter.
* Second player should enter his name and press enter.
* First player should enter his symbol [X or O] and press enter.
* To choose a position you have to type the corresponding number and press enter.
* The game will check if the chosen number is valid or not valid.
* If it's not valid (i.e already taken number or not of the game positions - from 1 to 9 ) it will ask for another input.
* If it's valid it will display the board with the chosen position replaced by the symbol of the player [X, O].
* Then it will ask the next player to take a turn.
* It will repeate the same for the second player.
* The game continues until it reaches either a winning or a draw condition.

Winning conditions
There are 8 winning conditions...

* First three: to have occupied a full row with the same symbol [X, O]
* Second three: to have occupied a column with same symbol [X, O]
* Last two: to have occupied a full diagonal with same symbol [X, O]

Draw condition

* If 9 movements are made with no winner then the game is a draw.

## Getting Started


* Navigate to the project's directory using the `cd` command

To run this program on your local machine, simply follow the steps below:

* Open your terminal - Windows: `Win + R`, then type `cmd` | Mac: `Command + space`, then type `Terminal`
* Navigate to a directory of your choosing using the `cd` command
* Run this command in your OS terminal: `git clone https://github.com/German-Cobian/Tic-Tac-Toe` to clone this repo in your local machine
* `cd` into the `Tic-Tac-Toe` folder
* Run `ruby bin/main.rb` and play the game from command line following the prompts it supplies


## Testing with RSpec 

This project is tested with RSpec which is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in the Ruby programming language. To get Rspec running do the following:

* Run `gem install rspec` in the terminal. This command installs Rspec on your computer 
* Ensure that RSpec is installed by running `rspec --version` which lists the installed version
* You should get output similar to the following:
  ```
    RSpec 3.10
      rspec-core 3.10.1
      rspec-expectations 3.10.1
      rspec-mocks 3.10.2
      rspec-support 3.10.2
    ```
* The rspec gem comes packed with all you need to get started including the 5 gems listed above
* Run the following command to initialize Rspec: `rspec --init` This generates a /spec folder and a .rspec file at the root of your project
* Finally, to run the tests, simply run `rspec`
