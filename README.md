# tic-tac-toe-game
This is the implementation of the popular TIC-TAC-TOE Game created using the Ruby programming Language

The first milestone is to create the necessary files and folders and make the file executable

Tic Tac Toe - Ruby OOP
Game Rules
- Each player is going to choose a number out of 9 positions.
- First player should enter his name and press enter.
- Second player should enter his name and press enter.
- First player should enter his symbol [X or O] and press enter.
- To choose a position you have to type the corresponding number and press enter.
- The game will check if the chosen number is valid or not valid.
- If it's not valid (i.e already taken number or not of the game positions - from 1 to 9 ) it will ask for another input.
- If it's valid it will display the board with the chosen position replaced by the symbol of the player [X, O].
- Then it will ask the next player to take turn.
- It will repeate the same for the second player.
- The game contiues till it reaches either winning or draw conditions.

Winning conditions
We have 8 winning conditions...

- First three, to have occupied a full row with the same symbol [X, O]
- Second three, to have occupied a column with same symbol [X, O]
- Third two, to have occupied a full diagonal with same symbol [X, O]

Draw condition
- If 9 movements achieved with no winning then the game is a draw.
