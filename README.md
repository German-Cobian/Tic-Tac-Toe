Game Rules
* Each player is going to choose a number out of 9 positions.
* First player should enter his name and press enter.
* Second player should enter his name and press enter.
* First player should enter his symbol [X or O] and press enter.
* To choose a position you have to type the corresponding number and press enter.
* The game will check if the chosen number is valid or not valid.
* If it's not valid (i.e already taken number or not of the game positions - from 1 to 9 ) it will ask for another input.
* If it's valid it will display the board with the chosen position replaced by the symbol of the player [X, O].
* Then it will ask the next player to take a turn.
* It will repeate the same for the second player.
* The game continues untill it reaches either a winning or a draw conditions.

Winning conditions
There are 8 winning conditions...

* First three, to have occupied a full row with the same symbol [X, O]
* Second three, to have occupied a column with same symbol [X, O]
* Third two, to have occupied a full diagonal with same symbol [X, O]

Draw condition
* If 9 movements are made with no winner then the game is a draw.


## Built With

* Ruby
* RSpec

## Getting Started

- To run this program on your local machine, simply follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
* Install the ruby programming language.

### Usage
* Clone this repo on your local machine by running `git@github.com:German-Cobian/Tic-Tac-Toe.git`
* `cd` into the `Tic-Tac-Toe` folder you just cloned.
* Run `ruby main.rb`
* Run the program from command line following the prompts it supplies.

### Testing with Rspec
  This project is tested with Rspec which is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in the Ruby programming language.


### How to get Rspec Running
* Run the following command in the terminal: `gem install rspec`
* This command installs Rspec on your computer. You ensure that Rspec is installed by running the following command to see the installed version: `rspec --version`
* You should get output similar to the following:
    RSpec 3.10
      rspec-core 3.10.1
      rspec-expectations 3.10.1
      rspec-mocks 3.10.2
      rspec-support 3.10.2
* The rspec gem comes packed with all you need to get started including the 5 gems listed above.
* Navigate into the `AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables` folder by running `cd AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables`
* Run the following command to initialize Rspec: `rspec --init`
* This generates a /spec folder and a .rspec file at the root of your project.
* Finally, to run the tests, simply run `rspec`
